## Description
Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students
This project was designed to outline and introduce the use of introductory coding concepts. It is intended to increase comfort and familiarity with the included concepts. It addresses the basics of how those coding languages are used, some of the differences between them, and how to implement basic coding in HTML, CSS, and JS files. It was also intended to create added familiarity with uploading commits to Git and merging feature branches with the main branch. I learned some of the basic coding language for HTML, CSS, and JS and how to integrate new changes into my GitHUb repository.
